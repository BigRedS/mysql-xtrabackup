mysql-xtrabackup - use Percona's xtrabackup to back up a MySQL server

Usage:

    mysql-xtrabackup [options]


OPTIONS: 

Help:

  --help:         see this help
  --help-install: see instructions to install innobackupex

Credentials:

  By default, a credentials file is used to connect to the mysqld, the default 
  path for this is /etc/mysql-xtrabackup/defaults

  Behaviour here is defined by innobackupex, this script does no sanitising.

  --defaults-file [path]

    Explicitly set the path to the defaults file

 --no-defaults-file
    
    Don't use a defaults file

  --username [user], --password [pass] and --hostname [host]

    Specify credentials when not using a defaults file. 

Output and logging:

  --no-log
    
    Don't write a log file; everything to STDOUT instead

  --log-dir:

    Directory in which to write a log. See 'label' below for info on log naming
    Default: /var/log/mysql-xtrabackup/

Backing up:

  --innobackupex [path]

    path to the innobackupex binary. Default: /usr/bin/innobackupex

  --innobackupex-option

    Set an innobackupex option; call multiple times to set several options. To 
    avoid confusing the options parser, use the --opt=value syntax, eg:

      --innobackupex-option=--parallel=10

  --backups-dir [path]

    path to the directory in which to keep the backups. 
    Default: /home/mysql-xtrabackup/

  --label

    A label to use for the backups. Influences the logfile's name, and normally
    one of "daily", "weekly" or "monthly" but only by convention. It mey be any
    string

  --no-tar
    
    By defalt, the resulting directory is gzipped and tarred, setting --no-tar 
    causes the backup to be left as a directory. This also disables the pruning.

  --tar [command]

    Tar invocation; passed two arguments, the name of the tarball to create and
    the name of the directory to tar. Must, therefore, include the arguments. 
    Default: 'tar -czvf'

  --max-days [num]

    Number of days to keep backups for. When a label is set and tarring is not
    disabled, on succesful taking of a backup, all tarballs older than this 
    number of days with this label are deleted. No pruning is done if this is
    left unset.

  --lockfile

    Path to lockfile created to avoid having two processes running at the same 
    time. Default: /tmp/mysql-xtrabackup.lock


LABELS

Labels are used to distinguish between backups of a different purpose, most 
likely those of a different period. When a label is set a subdirectory is 
created in the backups directory named for it, and so the max-days set only 
affects those.

Consider two cronsjobs:

  0 3  1 * * mysql-xtrabackup --label monthly --max-days 90
  0 17 * * * mysql-xtrabackup --label weekly --max-days 14

The first will be backed up into a directory /home/mysql-xtrabackup/monthly/, 
and the pruning will delete backups in the monthly/ directory older than 90
days.

The second will use a directory at /home/mysql-xtrabackup/weekly/, and the 
pruning will delete backups in weekly/ older than 14 days, but leave anything
in any other subdirectory.

If --label is unset, the backups just go into /home/mysql-xtrabackup, and 
pruning is disabled.


The logfile is also named in accordance with the labelling. The intention is 
to create a self-rotating log system. Daily logs are named for the day of the
week so there's always seven, for example.

The rules are:

  Label    |           Pattern                  |    Example
  ---------+------------------------------------+----------------------------
  daily    | <day name>-daily | mon-daily       |  tue-daily
  weekly   | <month name>-<day of month>-weekly |  feb-19-weekly
  monthly  | <month name>-monthly               |  feb-monthly
  hourly   | <hour>h-hourly                     |  17h-hourly
  empty    | y-m-d_H.M.S                        |  2018-02-19_17:04:12
  *        | y-m-d_H.M.S_<label>                |  2018-02-19_17:04:12_thing

That is, any non-empty string that's not daily, weekly, monthly or hourly will
just be appended verbatim to the end of the logfile's name.


DETECTING FAILURE

On succesful completion, the last line logged will be "Exiting OK" prefixed 
with a timestamp, and an exit value of 0.

Any problems result in a non-zero exit status and a log-line with an error
message in it.
